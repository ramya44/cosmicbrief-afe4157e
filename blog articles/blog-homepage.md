## Why Vedic?

Most horoscopes use Western tropical astrology, which drifted from the actual stars centuries ago. Vedic astrology (Jyotish) stays aligned with the constellations as they appear in the sky today.

It also uses **nakshatras** — 27 lunar mansions that reveal nuance Western astrology can't capture. Your Moon's nakshatra alone says more about your inner world than your sun sign ever could.

This isn't about prediction. It's about pattern recognition — understanding the rhythms that have always been there, so you can move with them instead of against them.
